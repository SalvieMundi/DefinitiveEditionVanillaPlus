<h2 id="about">About the Modpack</h2>
This fabric modpack is for Minecraft 1.17.1, and will only run on a legitimately purchased version of Minecraft Java Edition. It runs the official Mojang Caves & Cliffs Preview Datapack, and so has all the caves of 1.18, and with the addition of new biomes from various mods, has some of the cliff and mountain biomes as well. On top of all 1.17.1 features and most 1.18 features, it adds a ton of new content that feels decidedly close to vanilla Minecraft's gameplay.

This modpack was created with the following 4 philosophies in mind:

 1. A mod should *never* actively hinder the vanilla experience, and only aim to add more, bigger or better features to what already exists in-game. More mobs, bigger structures, better game feel -- all without sacrificing the original items, creatures and gameplay concepts that make Minecraft the game everybody loves to play.
 
 2. A mod should have the same amount of polish, care and detail put into it as any official Mojang vanilla feature: this includes conveyance to the player about mechanics the mod introduces, good graphical portrayal, good sound design and exceptionally fun game feel.
 
 3. A modpack should, in total, create a sense of wonder in the player that keeps them engaged and encourages exploration.
 
 4. A modpack should be stable -- at least as free from glitches and bugs as the vanilla game -- and should never introduce technical hoops for the player to jump through. Mechanics and modifications should be simple, understandable, and consistent.

With that in mind, some mods currently available for fabric contained features meeting these philosophies, while others did not and were not included. Some contained several features meeting these requirements, and several others that didn't -- those mods were further edited in their code, the sources for which can be downloaded from my forked repositories. And, of course, any mods not available for 1.17.1 were not included.

In total, there are 369 mods included in this modpack, which will be further described in the <a href="#mods">Mods & Authors</a> section.

<h2 id="req">System Requirements</h2>

<h3>Vanilla Minecraft Java Edition</h3>
This modpack, while very large, actually won't require much more resources than Vanilla Minecraft. The system requirements for Minecraft Java Edition can be found below:
<br /><br />

| Component | Minimum Requirements | Recommended Requirements |
|--|--|--|
|CPU|Dual Core @ 3.0 GHz|Quad Core @ 3.5GHz|
|GPU|Integrated Graphics|Dedicated Graphics|
|RAM|4GB|8GB|
|HDD|1GB|4GB|

<br />

<h3>Minecraft Vanilla+ Definitive Edition</h3>

The mods will add some strain to your CPU and RAM requirements. GPU requirements will largely be unchanged. The installer is roughly 250MB and will install roughly 450MB of content.
